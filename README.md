**neuro-chronical-prediction**

**Introduction**

This project delves into the development of an AI model for predicting neurological conditions using chronological data. 

**Environment Setup**

To embark on your neuro-chronical-prediction project, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. **Python 3:** Download and install Python 3 from the official website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on some systems). It should display the installed Python version.
2. **pip:** pip is the package installer for Python. Check if it's installed by running `pip3 --version` (or `pip --version`). If not, refer to Python's documentation for installation instructions.

**Specific Environment with Commands**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   - Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your system. Here's how to create one using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv neuro_chronical_pred_env  
   ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source neuro_chronical_pred_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   neuro_chronical_pred_env\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Once the virtual environment is active, use `pip` to install the necessary libraries for your project. Common choices for machine learning tasks include:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
